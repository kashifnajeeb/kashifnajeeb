My name is Kashif Najeeb, and I was born in 2004 in Lahore, Pakistan. Growing up, I attended one of the best schools in the city, Lahore Grammar School. It was during my time there that my fascination with Information Technology began to blossom. From a young age, I displayed a keen interest in IT, consistently achieving top scores in Computer Science and demonstrating proficiency with a mouse and keyboard.

In 2015, I embarked on a journey to the United Arab Emirates, where I enrolled in a school that provided ample opportunities for me to excel in IT. The move only fueled my passion for the field.

A year later, in 2016, at the age of eleven, I relocated once again, this time to Switzerland. Switzerland offered a new landscape for my academic and personal growth. As a student there, I delved deeper into IT, creating videos for my YouTube channels and launching my first website.

As I progressed through my schooling in Switzerland, I undertook a significant project for my final year. This project involved creating a website that garnered significant attention and popularity by 2020, while I was still a student. The success of this project caught the eye of Switzerland's largest newspaper publisher, 20 Minutes, who offered me an internship opportunity. Unfortunately, due to constraints related to my work permit, I was unable to accept the offer. However, this setback only fueled my determination to further enhance my skills in the field of Information Technology.
